### Summary

My current goal is to become hired front-end developer so I can make a decent living with it. I am a naturalized US Citizen and fluent in English as well as Russian. I've graduated with an AAS degree in Computer Information Systems with various certificates from Portland Community College. In this course, I'm looking to build my professional network, solidify and extend my knowledge, and develop my portfolio.

### Skills
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap, SASS, LESS)
* Javascript (TypeScript, React, Vue.js, Vuex)
* Java
* PHP
* SQL (MySQL,Transact-SQL)
* Python

### Code Examples
While I had a lot of class projects during my educational years, I don't feel like sharing it since it often feels incomplete or lacks any sense to exist. Instead here is my sloppy PWA to-do list :D. I used **Vue.js** with **TypeScript**, **Bootstrap** for CSS. Tasks are draggable and information is stored via **localstorage**.
